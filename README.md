# Vigenere-Cipher-Encryptor.py
An Encryption Tool using Vigenere Cipher with extra layer of security

### Vigenere Cipher is a Symmetric Encryption Algorithm which depends on an Encryption Key which is known by both sides
### The Encryption mechanism depends mainly on the key 
### In this project, the Encryption doesn't depend only on the key, it also depends on the alphabitical order which forms an extra layer of security


## Instructions:
1- Enter the Encryption key. The key must be a combinations of lowercase english letters
2- Enter the alphabetical order in lowercase english letters
3- Enter the string you want to Encrypt in lower case english letters


Good Luck!
